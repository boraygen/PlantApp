# Plant App

An app born from a YouTube tutorial. Only the %20 of the design is mine. There are and will be useless buttons in the app, since this is only an exercise to me.

## 0.3
 - New page: Details page, where you see the details and the description of the specific plant. This page works with a PageView and a stable bottom navigation bar.
 - Home page bar updated which uses a more dynamic system now - Nested Scroll View with Sliver App Bar.
 - Less hard-coded material and more dynamic approach.
 - Most of the listViews now build dynamically.
